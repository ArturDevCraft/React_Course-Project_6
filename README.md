# Project Managment app

This project is my own work done as a task during "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)". It is an easy application to manage projects.

You can add and delete projects and tasks for each of them. I decided to add saving data in browser's local storage to keep information after page reload.

Used technologies: **React, Javascript, Tailwind**.
