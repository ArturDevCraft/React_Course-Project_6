# Project Managment app

Project is my own work done as task during "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)". It is simple application to manage projects.

You can add and delete projects and tasks for each one.
I decided to add storing data in browser local storage to keep informations after reloading page.

Used technologies: **React, Javascript, Tailwind**.
